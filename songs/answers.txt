The 100 songs from the listener in the songs.db has Avarage energy of 0.65906, Avarage valence of 0.484443 and Avarage danceability of 0.71646. Also, his two songs with the greater valence were "Shape of You" and "Finesse". So, I would say that this aura tends to Purple and Orange mostly.
Even though I could see the tendency line in the most valence songs, if I had counted only on the average values of evenrgy, valence and danceability (this last one the most), I would judge this listener probably as a calm and not very energetic person. So, the best way to characteriza a persons mood would be to take her most listened songs (let's say, her top 10) and judge their (the persons) mood by the avarage rate of energy and danceability of those.
